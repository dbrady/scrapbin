# TIL - Today I Learned
This is just a file I'm jamming into my scrapbin because I don't really have a
Documents folder in github. Maybe I should? I have a small set of repos I always
want on every machine -- dotfiles, scrapbin, emacs/prelude, etc. And there ARE a
few docs piling up in my bin directory...
