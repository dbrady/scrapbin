# DATA is a "File" object, you can call .read and .each_line on it, etc.
puts DATA.read

__END__
This is a silly little demo of the __END__ and DATA keywords, which I have
written for myself here because I keep forgetting how they work. Fortunately,
whenever I google "ruby __DATA__" it knows what I am looking for. (And I am also
putting __DATA__ in here in case Future Me ever goes grepping in here for that
particular nonexistent keyword.)
